Algorithm to find the second largest number:

Step 1 – Start
Step 2 – Declare an array and get the inputs for that array using scanner class
Step 3 - Declare two for loop for iteration of all the elements.
Step 4 - In the second loop if(a[j] > a[i]) if this is true then using temp swap the two numbers
Step 5 - Then print the sorted array
Step 6 - Stop
