Algorithm to find the second largest number:

Step 1 – Start
Step 2 – Declare an array and get the inputs for that array using scanner class
Step 3 - Initialize the first variable with 0 and the second variable with the value -1
Step 4 - Start traversing the array and in each iteration check:
i)	If the current element in array i.e. a[i] is greater than the element at the index - first or not. If it is greater then update: second= first
first = i
ii)	If the value of current element is in between first and second, then update : 
     	      second = i
Step 5 - Return the value stored at the secondindex as the answer.
Step 6 - Stop
